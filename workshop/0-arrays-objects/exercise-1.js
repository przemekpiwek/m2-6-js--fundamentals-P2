// #1 and #10 are missing
//       #1 is 'bean burritos'
//      #10 is 'buffalo-flavored cauliflower' (not kidding)

// Write a program that will do the following:
// Add them to the array in the right position
// Output them in a tidy top-ten fashion in the console.

// NO for loops (use `forEach` instead)
